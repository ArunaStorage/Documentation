# Basic Usage

This section deals with the basics of using Aruna Object Storage (AOS). 
The first step is a basic introduction on how to get access to the storage system. 
In addition, there is a simple tutorial on how to connect to the gRPC gateway of an AOS instance using the client API packages and initialize the individual client services. 
However, this addition is only relevant if you plan to use one of the gRPC clients.

Finally, the next sections deal with the individual resource client services. 
The most basic operations are explained and each is presented with minimalistic examples for isolated use.

The individual sections can be selected in the navigation on the left or run through individually via the footer.
