# How to use the EventNotification API

## Introduction

The AOS supports an event notification service which can be used to subscribe to specific resources.
The subscription can be generally for every kind of modification of the resource or even specific actions.

After subscription, you will receive mail notifications if something happens with the resource which fits your subscription conditions e.g. update or deletion.
